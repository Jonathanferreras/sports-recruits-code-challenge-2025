# Sports Recruits Code Challenge

## Getting Started

I wanted to make this project super simple to run, which is why I utilized Laravel's Sail feature for the project.

1. Git clone the project and cd into the project folder.

2. Open a terminal within the project directory and run the following command: `./vendor/bin/sail up && ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev -- --host`

3. Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost>

### Disclaimer

To optimize time and efficiency, I leveraged ChatGPT/AI for select technical aspects of this project. That said, I took ownership of the application’s architecture, making key design decisions and ensuring best practices were consistently applied in the code I authored.

I strongly believe that as software engineers, our core responsibility is solving problems—while languages, frameworks, and tools are simply means to achieve that end.
